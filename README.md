## What is this?

This is a Hearthstone clone, for Unity.

## Usage

Can't really be played yet. You can open it up in unity to take a look, though.

```
git clone https://github.com/HMAN1911/unity_tcg

```

Afterwards, open unity_tcg folder as a project in unity.

## Log

Working on the visuals so far, nothing too exciting. Next step is to build out the back face of the cards.

Card back and front faces complete, card rotation working via raycasting method.
